## Overview

### Project Insight

   Welcome to Cybertron, traveler. The war is ongoing, and now the clans of autonomous robots needs your help in identifying them from others!
   This application is modeled after a traditional "memory" game. The goal is to click on as many unique Transformers as possible, without clicking the same one twice. If you click the same one twice, you'll start over! Push yourself, Cybertron is depending on you!

### Technologies Utilized

* **Backend**: React.js & Yarn
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript(ES6), Bootstrap
* **Other**: Heroku

## Instructions

1) Click on any Transformer that you please

**If not clicked before**

2) Your "score" tally will increase

* If you managed to beat your high score, (firstly, congrats!) your new highest score count will be displayed in the appropiate field. Keep it up!

3) Rinse-repeat step 1 until you win, or accidentally click the same Transformer twice

**If previously clicked before**

2) You'll receive an alert saying you already clicked that one, and that the game will now restart

* If you managed to beat your high score before losing, the new highest score will be displayed in he appropiate field.

3) Go back to step 1, and rinse-repeat.

### The future of Cybertron is depending on your observation and memory apitute, traveler!
